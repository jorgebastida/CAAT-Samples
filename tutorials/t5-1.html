            <h2>Time line hooks</h2>

            <p>
                As we've said, an Scene has its own timeline. This is a virtual timeline,
                which is fed by the Director and is independant of other scene's time line.</p>
                An Scene will start feeding is timeline as soon as it starts to be brought
                in to the Director.
                An Scene will stop feeding is timeline as soon as the Director finishes starts
                taking the scene out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Scene's timeline will be the reference time passed to all of its children
                as their current animation time.
            </p>

            <p>
                When an Scene is not anymore visible its timeline will be paused until the
                Scene will again be elligible to feed its timeline.
            </p>

            <p>
                Exactly as the Director, the Scene can set hooks by setting a function
                <span class="apicode">onRenderStart</span> and a function
                <span class="apicode">onRenderEnd</span>.
                These both methods will receive a parameter with scene's virtual time.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's another hook point on scenes and is the method <span class="apicode">
                activated</span>. If set, this method will be called when the scene is totally
                brought in and is ready to receive input events.
            </p>
